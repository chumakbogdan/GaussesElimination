# GaussesElimination
The goal of this project is to implement a program that solves a system of linear equations using three different methods of Gaussian elimination:
	1.	Basic method (without choosing the maximum element);
	2.	Column-wise pivoting (choosing the maximum element in the current column);
	3.	Full pivoting (choosing the maximum element in the remaining submatrix).
 Project also allows to choose either you want to use prepared data or input the matrix by yourself
